Welcome back to the Bot project. In part 2, we'll modify the existing code by accepting user input to make it more interarive.
let's start with the first questoin.
A1. Remove the line where you declare the name variable and assign it a value. 
A2. Add input function to capture the user's input and add "Hello! What is your name?" as the argument between the parentheses. 
Run the program and enter your name when prompted in the console. You'll see the program stops and waits for the user's input when using the input function.
Also , mote that we can keave a space in the promt used in the input function to make it easier for our user to type in their name, as we then have a whitespace between the quetion mark and the start of the user's text.

script.py 
print("Hello! What is your name?")
name = input ("Hello! What is your name?")
print(f"Nice to meet your, {name}!")
print("How old are you?")
age = 10
bot_age = 3 
age_difference = age- bot_age
print("you are {age_difference} years older than me. I'm onle {bot_age} years old !")
print("What's Your favorite color?")
color = "blue"
Print(f"Oh, {color} is a beautiful color!")

Our bot now twice asks the user's what their name is. Once because of the first print statement and once because of the newly added input function.
A1. Remove the print statement to display the question only once (using input function instead of print)

name = input ("Hello! What is your name?")
print(f"Nice to meet your, {name}!")
print("How old are you?")
age = 10
bot_age = 3 
age_difference = age- bot_age
print("you are {age_difference} years older than me. I'm onle {bot_age} years old !")
print("What's Your favorite color?")
color = "blue"
Print(f"Oh, {color} is a beautiful color!")

Continuing from there, Let's make the user type in their age insead of defining it in the code itself.
A1. Replace the line where we define the age variable with the input function use "How old are your?" with the input function and save the recived input in a variable called age_input.
A2. Create a vreable called age and use the int funtion to transform the input into a number like age= int(age_input).
A3. Remove the print function display "How old are you?" to not ask twice.

name = input ("Hello! What is your name?")
print(f"Nice to meet your, {name}!")
age_input = input("How old are you?")
age = int (age_input)
bot_age = 3 
age_difference = age- bot_age
print("you are {age_difference} years older than me. I'm onle {bot_age} years old !")
print("What's Your favorite color?")
color = "blue"
Print(f"Oh, {color} is a beautiful color!")

Finally, let the user share their favorite color insead of pre-fillinit
