WE can use comparison operators in programs. Check if the answeer to a question is correct.
  script.py

  answer= "Picasso"
  if answer == "Picasso":
    print (answer + "is correct !")

What if the answer isn't correct? We can use the inequality oprator != to check if answer is not equal to "Picasso"

  scripy.py
  answer = "Matisse"
  if answer != "Picasso":
    print (answwer "is wrong!")
