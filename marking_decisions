Smart programs use booleans to make decision on whether to run lines of code or skip them.
A1. We use an if statement to write code that respond to different situations. We recognize it by the keyword if.

script.py 
if True:
  print ("Hello!")
  
A2. But what if we want to stop the code?
In that case, we need that statement to evaluate as false.
Let's easily make the statement evaluate to false by simply using the boolean value false. Nothing will print.

script.py
if false:
 print("Hello!")

 Q1 What are the value that decide whether a code block runs or not?
