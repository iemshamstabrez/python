shopping_list = ["apple", "banana", "bread", "milk", "chips", "eggs"]       
for item in shopping_list:
    if item == "chips":
        continue
    print (f" Don't forget to buy {item}.")
# Output:

#another code starts from here
#  
for i in range(1, 6):
    if i == 3:
        break
    print(i)

# next code 
password = "open_sesame"
while True:
    user_input = input("Enter the password: ")
    if user_input == password:
        print("Access granted.")
        break                                       
        print("Access denied. Try again.")

        finally the elese statement in loop is executed when the loop has finished. Remember, else in a loop differs from else in an if statememt.
    
     for i in range(6):
        print(i)
    else:
        print('loop finished')
# Output:
