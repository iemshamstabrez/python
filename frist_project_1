Welcome to our first Python project , during which you'll build a simple bot.
In this first part , we'll take the conversation , but already in the second part of the project, you'll capture input to make this a real conversation.
###1. Add the print function to display ("Hello! What is your name ?")###

print("Hello! What is your name ?")

2. To mimic the user's input , lets create a variable for the user's name. 
a1. Add a variable called name and assign it a string value. Maybe your name?
a2. After declaring the variable , add a second print statement. Use the f- srting method to display f"Nice to meet you , {neme}!"

print("Hello! What is your name ?")
name="Sam"
print(f"Nice to meet you , {name}!")

Our bot should continue the convesation with the user by asking how old they are.
A1. Use the print function to display "How old are you?"

print("Hello! What is your name ?")
name="Sam"
print(f"Nice to meet you , {name}!")
print("How old are you ?")

Create a variable to the user's age ant the age of our bot. We'll later compare the two.
A1. Add a variable name age and assign it a value. Feel free to use your actual age. 
A2. Add a variable named bot_age and assign it a value of 3. 

script.py 
print("Hello! What is your name ?")
name="Sam"
print(f"Nice to meet you , {name}!")
print("How old are you ?")
age=10
age_bot=3

Calculate the difference between the user's subtracts the bot's age from the value of the variable age.

script.py 
print("Hello! What is your name ?")
name="Sam"
print(f"Nice to meet you , {name}!")
print("How old are you ?")
age=10
age_bot=3
age_difference= age- bot_age


Display a message about the age difference and the bot's age.
A1. Use the print function and an f-string to display "You are {age_difference} years older thsn me. I'm only {bot_age}
 years old!"

script.py 
print("Hello! What is your name ?")
name="Sam"
print(f"Nice to meet you , {name}!")
print("How old are you ?")
age=10
age_bot=3
age_difference= age- bot_age
print(f"You are {age_difference} years older thsn me. I'm only {bot_age} years old!")

let's have our bot ask the usser about their favorite coler.
A1. Use the print function to display "What's your favorite color?"

script.py 
print("Hello! What is your name ?")
name="Sam"
print(f"Nice to meet you , {name}!")
print("How old are you ?")
age=10
age_bot=3
age_difference= age- bot_age
print(f"You are {age_difference} years older thsn me. I'm only {bot_age} years old!")
print("What's your favorite color?")

Create a variable for the user's favorite color and make the bot respond with a compliment. 
A1. Add a variable named color and assign it a value.
A2. Use the print function and f-string to display "Oh, {color} is abeautiful color!"

script.py 
print("Hello! What is your name ?")
name="Sam"
print(f"Nice to meet you , {name}!")
print("How old are you ?")
age=10
age_bot=3
age_difference= age- bot_age
print(f"You are {age_difference} years older thsn me. I'm only {bot_age} years old!")
print("What's your favorite color?")
color= "Black"
print("Oh, {color} is abeautiful color!")
