Welcome to your first Python project , during which you'll build a simpple bot.
In this first part , we'll take the conversation , but already in the second part of the project, you'll capture input to make this a real conversation.
1. Add the print function to display ("Hello! What is your name ?")
print("Hello! What is your name ?")
2. To mimic the user's input , lets create a variable for the user's name. 
a1. Add a variable called name and assign it a string value. Maybe your name?
a2. After declaring the variable , add a second print statement. Use the f- srting method to display f"Nice to meet you , {neme}!"
print("Hello! What is your name ?")
name="Sam"
print(f"Nice to meet you , {neme}!")
Our bot shiuld continue the convesation with the user by asking how old they are.
A1. Use the print function to display "How old are you?"
print("Hello! What is your name ?")
name="Sam"
print(f"Nice to meet you , {neme}!")
print("How old are you ?")
