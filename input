Program are more fun if they cantake input from the outside.
When we run code, we can include the input to after the program.
We can use the input function as many times as we want.

1. The order of the instructions matters. Once we collect input and store it in a variable, we reuse it. 

print("What's your name?")
name_input= input()
print(f"Hi, {name_input}!")

2. The input is always of type string. If we want to use it as a number, we need to convert it to an integer or float beforehand.

user_input_1 = input("Enter a number:")
user_input_2 = input("Enter another number:")
number1= int(user_input_1)
number2= int(user_input_2)
result= number1+ number2
print(f" The sum is {result}")

3. We can also use in floats number to repleace int into float

user_input_1 = input("Enter a number:")
user_input_2 = input("Enter another number:")
number1= float(user_input_1)
number2= float(user_input_2)
result= number1+ number2
print(f" The sum is {result}")
